Current Task from Context: researching restaurants

LLM Response: Okay, I'll refine the restaurant search to only include Italian restaurants.  I need more information to do this effectively.  Specifically, I need a directory or file containing restaurant information, including their cuisine type.  Please provide me with the path to such a file or directory.  I will then use the appropriate tool to filter the results.
